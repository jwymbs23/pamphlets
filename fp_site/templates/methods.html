	<h3>Methods</h3>
	<p> To track sentiment about terms over the course of the French Revolution, we use a lexicon-based Sentiment Analysis to assign a “polarity” to each pamphlet for each occurence of the term. This method involves parsing phrases where the term appears for words that are associated with some degree of positive or negative sentiment. Using this straightforward method to translate each pamphlet into a set of scores allows for a wide range of statistical analysis that would be impossible to do any other way, especially considering the sheer number of pamphlets. </p>
	<p>We wanted users to be able to add new terms to the list of words that can be analyzed, so the first thing that we had to do was index the documents in the collection. Indexing the documents essentially transposes the documents and the words that they contain, so that when you search a word in the index, you get a list of documents that contain that word, and you get that list much more quickly than would be possible by searching the entire collection. We decided to use the pylucene Python package to index the documents. With the documents indexed, it is possible to search the 30000 pamphlets in a reasonable amount of time. After a user searches for a term, information about that term is saved to a database so that each search really only needs to be performed once. </p>
	<h3>Sentiment Analysis </h3>
	<p> The method that we chose to use to do the sentiment analysis itself was intentionally kept simple. Using a list of french words that had been assigned a positive and negative sentiment score, we calculate the overall sentiment in passages that mention the user's search term. There were no topic or era specific lists that we were able to find, so we decided to use the largest sentiment word list that we could (FEEL). This is a list compiled from modern french word usage, so may not always reflect the sentiment that the words expressed at the time. Furthermore, whether a word like 'revolution' is positive or negative depends strongly on the context which is a problem even the most accurate word list wouldn't be able to solve. We tried to mitigate some of these issues by averaging the sentiment score over a 'stemmed' version of the word list, and stemming terms from the documents. Stemming is a process whereby a word is reduced to its root algorithmically, and is often used in natural language processing to reduce the large space of all possible words to a smaller subset. With our stemmed data, we tried several different ways of performing the actual calculation, and chose the method that gave the most stable results. After a term is specified, we search the documents and analyze a window of words around each occurrence of the search term. Words that are near the edges of the window (or far from the term) have a lower sentiment weight than words that are closer. Again, choosing the size of the window is subjective, a window that is too small might miss important information, and a window that is too big can capture sentiment about different topics. We chose a window size of 30 words before and after which seemed to provide a nice balance between specificity and thoroughness. </p>
	<p> As you may have noticed while exploring this site, spelling errors and discrepancies are pervasive in the document collection. The documents were processed by OCR (optical character recognition) which does a decent job of translating text on the page to text on the screen, but with documents of varying quality, we couldn't expect it to be perfect. The project you see now includes very limited spelling correction, though we have made progress on a method that compiles a list of common single letter replacements and uses those as well as word frequencies to make internally consistent word replacements. We haven't included this method yet, but it was able to increase the fraction of words in the documents that appear in a modern french dictionary from roughly 5% to 40%. These numbers don't include word count, only whether a word appears, and so don't reflect poorly on the quality of the document collection. </p>
	<h3> Trending Terms </h3>
	<p> There are lots of ways to think about 'trending terms', but we chose to approach the problem by saying that a word is trending in a particular year if it is used at a significantly higher rate in that year than in the others. We calculated 'tf-idf' scores for each term in each year, and show the top 20. Measuring tf-idf, which stands for term frequency-inverse document frequency weights a term by the number of times that it appears in a 'document' (in this specific context, 'document' means all pamphlets that were published in a given year), and by the number of times it appears in the collection overall. Common words like 'the' appear frequently in a 'document', but also in the collection as a whole, so have a low tf-idf score.</p>

	<p> We plan to continue adding functionality and different analyses to the site, and would love to hear your feedback or questions! Get in touch at joseph.w.harder (a gmail account).</p>
