	<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>
	<p>In 1789, for the first time, public opinion determined political power. As the public struggled to achieve “liberté, égalité, fraternité,” they backed one governing body and then the next, making the French Revolution seem more like the French Revolving Door. The Newberry pamphlet collection represents an opportunity to explore how public discourse influenced the events of the French Revolution. We used Sentiment Analysis to measure the strength and polarity of opinions that these pamphlets express about major players in the Revolution. This analysis can be used to systematically reveal long term and large scale trends in the public discourse that account for the rise and fall of the various forms of government.</p>
	<p> Ultimately, our analysis seeks to answer three questions: To what extent do the emotions expressed in the pamphlets reflect or presage events of the Revolution? Does the range of emotion in the pamphlets, many of which contain propaganda, intensify or diverge leading up to crisis points? And finally, can we see the seeds of internecine conflicts in a divergence of opinion between initially similar pamphlet authors over time?</p>
	
	<p> Regarding the first question about whether sentiment in the pamphlets reflects events on the ground of the French Revolution, we look at emotion expressed both generally and about specific people leading up to their executions. The first plot below shows the sentiment score averaged over all words in all the documents that were published between 1780 and 1804. Clearly, the sentiment in the documents reflects some sort of crisis in 1787, and the emotional tenor in the documents doesn't reach its pre-revolution level until around 1796. As in all analysis of these documents, there could be some selection bias in that the set of pamphlets were specifically chosen as being relevant to the revolution. That there are swings of emotion within the collection, and that these swings correspond well with the most tumultuous times of the revolution suggests that this analysis can give us insights about the discourse of the revolution.

	<p> Next, in a more specific example of how the documents are connected to actual events, we plot the sentiment score of passages that mention people who eventually went to the guillotine as a function of the time to the year in which they were guillotined. This analysis only includes people who appear in more than 300 documents to ensure that there are enough documents from a wide enough time range. It would be hard to make any predictions using the individual curves, but an average of all of the sentiment curves, shown in bold suggests that there might be a turn towards more negative emotion in the year before the guillotine year, and certainly, that there is a dip after. The dip after could be explained by the negative polarity associated with words related to death, but that the scores dip a little bit before is suggestive. It would be really great to have more granular data about when these document were published, this data is often present in the document text, and an interesting future project would be to build a date parser, or to manually assign publication dates to a subset of the documents.</p>

	<p>To take this analysis further, we can take advantage of the fact that these pamphlets often had wildly different opinions about the same people or concepts. Instead of looking at the simple average sentiment score, we can look at the spread in emotion between the most positive and negative pamphlets about a figure. The plot below shows this spread for the same set of people who appear in the previous plot. The spread between the most positive and negative emotions reaches a peak in the year that that person went to the guillotine, and begins to increase as early as 5 years before.

	<p>Analysis of the origins of internecine conflict are still to come.
